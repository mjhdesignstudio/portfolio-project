        While I started playing my first instrument
        <em>Viola</em>, in fifth grade, as you can see in the photo above, I
        have been around music since I was very little. As a young child, I
        remember almost always having some type of music playing around the
        house. Whether it was classical or country, music was a constant in my
        life.
        <br />
        I played for the local youth symphony from middle school through high
        school and was fortunate enough to travel with them to Italy and later
        Germany with my university's symphony orchestra. Since then, I have
        started playing several other instruments including violin, acoustic
        guitar, bass guitar, and even some piano.
